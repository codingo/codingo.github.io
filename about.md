I'm the current Global Head of Security Ops and Researcher Enablement for Bugcrowd, an ex-pentester for NCC Group and the Maintainer of NoSQLMap, VHostScan, Reconnoitre, Interlace, Crithit and others. I make instructional content for fun hosted here, as well as tools I feel would benefit the security community on Github. If you wish to contribute any changes to either, you may do so via [Github](https://github.com/codingo/codingo.github.io).

You can find the source code for most items featured on this blog on:
